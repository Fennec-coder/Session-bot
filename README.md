#Area of **hate**

Hi, here I want to talk about how much I hate sevga. I understand that the code I wrote is complete crap, but nevertheless, this is at least some kind of initiative.

The situation in a nutshell:
SevSU is an incredible place, so awful that you can't even find words. The schedule can change every week, the rector is a complete idiot and ordered to issue assignments for holidays and weekends, which in Russia are called "non-working days" and "national unity day", he said this so that the students did not relax, there were so many tasks that work every day "without getting up". Of course, I didn’t do anything, 4th year, I’m already working, but the situation infuriates.

What else pisses me off, oh yeah, back to the schedule, it changes often (very), it is not convenient to follow it and you know what .. THE UNIVERSITY HAS NO DISTRIBUTION BASE! Instead of them, excel files ... This garbage pissed me off from the second year, then I started making a bot .. yes, I was engaged in a bot for 2 years, this is its 4th iteration, but I'm an idiot. The bottom line is that I promoted the idea of ​​a bot that it can be used in such situations, not the fact that it was necessary to take my bot, I needed something convenient and that's it, now they use my bot, thank you, I love you. I don't use it myself, but okay.
