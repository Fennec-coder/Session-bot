# session-bot
A bot for working with a schedule, created to improve the convenience of students (sevgu) 

Guys, if you want to write something - write, I have been rewriting it for several years now, for fun, but he (the bot) has already bothered me so much that the breaks in development are more like abandoning the project. 

Getting Started
------------
To run the project, you need python 3.8, libraries: 

    pyTelegramBotAPI==4.0.0
    SQLAlchemy==1.4.23
    SQLAlchemy-Utils==0.37.8

    maybe there will be something else, I donâ€™t know..

Postgresql database is also needed, write its parameters to the file config/settings.ini, in the same place write the token for accessing your bot.

Launch is done through a file mine.py
